# DataScience-BankMarket-Segmentation-Python
Based on Extensive employee data develop a model to predict which employees are likely to quit.

* Carried out a marketing campaign by dividing the past 6 month customerâ€™s data in 3 distinctive groups to identify the customer needs.
* Performed Exploratory data analysis & visualized customers dataset using distplot, histograms, and KDE, also filled the null data points.
* Calculated optimal clusters using elbow method, Applied K means algorithms in Scikit learn to perform market segmentation
* Applied PCA and auto encoders to perform dimensionality reduction, also built and trained auto encoder models in keras.
